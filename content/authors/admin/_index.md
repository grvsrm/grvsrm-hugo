I am an Engineer and a Data Enthusiast. Before moving into Data Analytics, I spent a considerable time at Shop Floor in Automotive Industry. I am fairly exposed to Manufacturing and have a diversified work experience in various domains ranging from Industry 4.0 and Factory Digitization, Planning & Operations, Asset Maintenance and IT. My recent work interests are into building [factories of the future](https://www.effra.eu/sites/default/files/factories_of_the_future_2020_roadmap.pdf). I use data and analytics to solve business problems in Manufacturing as my inclination is more towards decision making using data rather than making data products.

I live in [Jaipur](http://www.tourism.rajasthan.gov.in/jaipur.html), India with my family, was born and brought up here and have spent a large part of my life here. Reading is my favorite thing to do when I am at leisure. Though I enjoy reading everything, nonetheless, Ancient to Modern History, Mythology and Religion, Human Evolution, Human Psychology are the genres, I generally prefer to read. Writing, Skygazing, Travelling are some of my other interests.

If you are interested in knowing more about my data related projects or my interests, do check various sections of this website. Please feel free to reach out to me on my social media handles given on the side bar in the left. You can also contact me via contact form available at the bottom of this page. Thank You..!

Happy Learning..!!
