I am an Engineer and a Data Scientist. Before moving into Data Science, I spent a considerable time in Manufacturing Industry. I started my career as an Opertaions and Maintenance Engineer and later moved to smart factory initiatives. I have a decent exposure to Industry 4.0 and Factory Digitization. I have a keen interest in using data to gain insights. My inclination is more towards decision making using data rather than making data products.

I have a varied area of interests. I am always keen in trying new things, learning is a life long journey for me. I find joy in doing different things. If you are interested in knowing more about data science projects, do check my portfolio below. Feel free to reach out to me on my social media handles given on the side bar in the left.

Happy Learning..!!
