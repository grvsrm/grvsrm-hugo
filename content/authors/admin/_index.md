>> Without data you're just another person with an opinion.

I am an Engineer and a Data Scientist. Before moving into Data Science, I spent a considerable time at Shop Floor in Automotive Industry. I am fairly exposed to Manufacturing and have a diversified work experienece in various domains ranging from Planning & Operations, Maintenance, IT etc; My recent work interests are into building [factories of the future](https://www.effra.eu/sites/default/files/factories_of_the_future_2020_roadmap.pdf).  My experience in implenmenting Industry 4.0 practices and Factory Digitization helps me a lot in pursuing my interest further. I have used data scinece to solve several business problems in Manufacturing. My inclination is more towards decision making using data rather than making data products.

I live in [Jaipur](http://www.tourism.rajasthan.gov.in/jaipur.html), India with my family, was born and brought up here and have spent a large part of my life here. I try different things and do things differently. Reading is my favorite thing to do when I am at leisure. Though I enjoy reading everything, nonetheless, Ancient to Modern History, Mythology and Religion, Human Evolution, Human Psychology are the genres, I generally prefer to read . Writing, Skygazing, TRavelling are some of my other interests. If you are interested in knowing more about my data science projects or my interests, do check various sections of this website. Please feel free to reach out to me on my social media handles given on the side bar in the left. YOu can also contact me via contact form available at the bottom of this page. Thank You..!

Happy Learning..!!
